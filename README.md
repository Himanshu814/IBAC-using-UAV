This repository contains the code and resources for the research project "Design of Image-Based Analysis and Classification Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle", published at the ICCES 2023 conference on June 1, 2023. The project aimed to enhance building damage assessment using UAV-collected imagery and deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview:
**1. Objective:** To utilize UAVs for collecting images of buildings and classify them into damaged and non-damaged categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The project further breaks down the classification of damaged buildings into levels D0, D1, D2-D3, and D4-D5, simplifying the damage assessment process for effective analysis.

**2. Publication:** Published in IEEE conference at ICCES 2023. Patent have been published and copyright is registered.

**3. Team:** Led a team of 2 members, where I was responsible for dataset collection and full project development.

## **Key Contributions:**

**1. Project Leadership:** Directed the project from inception to completion, including dataset acquisition and complete development of the codebase.

**2. Model Implementation:** Created and evaluated CNN models to classify building images, choosing the most efficient one for the final implementation.

**3. Training and Optimization:** Conducted model training and testing phases to fine-tune and optimize the accuracy and reliability of results.

**4. Research and Publication:** Authored the research paper detailing the methodology and findings and successfully secured a patent and copyright for the work.

## **Features:**
1. Implementation of CNN-based image classification.
2. Comparative analysis of various models to determine the optimal solution.
3. Detailed training and testing scripts for reproducibility.
4. Methods for assessing and classifying building damage levels from UAV imagery.
5. Feel free to explore, contribute, and use this repository for research and development in related fields.
